I have been digitizing Europe's Payments and Remittance sector for the past ten years. 
I am a seasoned (15+ years) Senior Manager in Banking, Payments & Finance industries. 
As a **Head of Sales and Integrations at Western Union (NYSE: WU)**, I sell and integrate the WU payments platform to Financial Institutions across EEA countries. 
My current role spans contract negotiations and business and compliance requirements set (AMLD, PSD, GDPR) through solution design and cross-functional team management in a highly regulated financial industry. 
Previously I was responsible for WU's digital expansion and development of the **WU App and westernunion.com**. 
I was integrating new payment methods, improving the customer onboarding and verification process and driving the overall WU digital product strategy for Central Europe. 
I also held various Business, Operations and Compliance roles in ABN Amro Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street Bank and Western Union. 

Since I was 8, I have been passionate about programming and learning foreign languages. **I am fluent in English, French and advanced in Spanish (C1). I am native Polish.**
